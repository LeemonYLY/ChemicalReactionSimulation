# ChemicalReactionSimulation
A chemical reaction simulator that calculates and simulates some parameters in a chemical reaction

Through a series of chemical kinetic formulas and parameters, 
this program simulates the calculation process of reaction rate, activation energy, equilibrium constant, etc. in chemical reactions, 
and outputs a comprehensive chemical reaction index.
